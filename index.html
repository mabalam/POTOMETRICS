          <h3>Understanding Macroeconomic Indicators: 3-month Treasury Rate</h3>

          <img src="images/3-mo-treasury.png" alt="3-month Treasury Rate" />
          <p>
            The figure above shows the 3-Month Treasury Rate (interest rate) in
            the United States. The data is sourced from the Federal Reserve
            Economic Data (FRED) database, which is maintained by the Federal
            Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The 3-Month Treasury Rate is an important
            indicator of short-term interest rates and is often used as a
            benchmark for other interest rates in the economy. It reflects the
            yield on U.S. government debt securities with a maturity of three
            months and is influenced by various factors, including monetary
            policy decisions by the Federal Reserve, inflation expectations, and
            overall economic conditions. Changes in the 3-Month Treasury Rate
            can have significant implications for borrowing costs, investment
            decisions, and overall economic activity.

          <h3>Historical Unemployment Rate</h3>
          <img src="images/unemployment.png" alt="Unemployment" />

          <p>
            The figure above shows the unemployment rate in the United States
            from. The data is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data
            (FRED) database, which is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of
            St. Louis. The unemployment rate is a key indicator of labor market
            conditions and reflects the percentage of the total labor force that
            is unemployed but actively seeking employment. It is calculated by
            dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor
            force and multiplying by 100. Changes in the unemployment rate can
            have significant implications for economic growth, consumer
            spending, and overall economic stability. Policymakers and
            economists closely monitor this indicator to assess the health of
            the economy and to make informed decisions regarding monetary and
            fiscal policies.
